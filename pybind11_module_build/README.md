# Writting a C extension module with pybind11

The C extension provides a convenient way of generating interface files for
python to read C(++) code. In this example is just the main.py file, and I do
not need to generate any setup.py file for anything. Though, if I want to
distribute the library, I'll probably have to do further processing.

All in all, pretty solid option.
