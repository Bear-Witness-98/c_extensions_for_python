# The fundamental nature of Cython can be summed up as follows: Cython
# is Python with C data types.

# Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python
# programming language and the extended Cython programming language
# (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as
# Python itself.

# The Cython language is a superset of the Python language that
# additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on
# variables and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate
# very efficient C code from Cython code.

# So I assume this module needs to be compiled to work.
